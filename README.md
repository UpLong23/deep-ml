> 📚 Solutions to Deep-ML.com problems — written from scratch using at most **NumPy**

This repository contains my personal solutions to coding challenges from **Deep-ML.com** — a machine-learning problem platform often described as *“LeetCode for ML”* where you solve ML, linear algebra, probability, statistics, and deep learning problems by implementing algorithms from the ground up. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

All solutions in this repo are implemented with minimal dependencies, using **only NumPy** (no high-level ML libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch) so that you deeply understand the math and mechanics behind the algorithms.

## 🧠 What’s Inside

Each file corresponds to a set of solutions around a topic — many of which mirror Deep-ML.com challenge areas:

| File | Topics Covered |
|------|----------------|
| `linalg.py` | Linear algebra utilities (matrix operations, decompositions) |
| `calculus.py` | Calculus functions (gradients, differentiation utilities) |
| `prob.py` | Probability problem implementations |
| `stats.py` | Statistics — distributions, estimators, hypothesis testing |
| `ml.py` | Core machine learning techniques (e.g., regression, k-NN) |
| `alexnet.ipynb` | Jupyter Notebook exploring AlexNet from scratch |

> > **Note:** This repo is meant for educational purposes — to explore how core ML concepts work under the hood without relying on specialized frameworks.
